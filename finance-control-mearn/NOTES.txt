Search filter dates: 

    .All Date types from search filters or new transactions sent to the backend must be in "YYYY-MM-DD" format to be parsed into Date object.
    . Dates are saved in UTC at midnight (0:00) on server to make date filtering easier disregarding time created. 
    . Displaying dates parsed with .toLocaleString() will show the day before if options 'timeZone: "UTC"' not specified, because browser will subtract -03:00 (brazilian local time) from 0:00Z (zulu time).

Creating and Deleting transactions :

    . Fetching transaction from server after creating and getting the mongoDb "_.id" is required to allow user to delete it right away if needed. Queries by "._id" are auto indexed by mongoDb and more performant.
